# AdonisJs FullStack App With Laravel Mix

[AdonisJs](http://adonisjs.com) + [Laravel Mix](https://laravel-mix.com/docs)

*Adonis* makes use of blueprints to create the files structure of a new project. This repository is just a blueprint that integrates *Adonis FullStack App* and *Laravel Mix*. You can use this as a start point for your Adonis + Laravel Mix projects.


## Install

Create a new project with:

```shell
  adonis new <my-project> --blueprint marcim/adonis-fullstack-app-laravelmix
```

> Change `<my-project>` to your project name.


## Usage

The Adonis `start` and `test` commands still there and the following commands are available to handle project assets:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| npm run asset-dev | Compiles assets in development mode. |
| npm run asset-watch | Compiles assets in development mode and watches changes. |
| npm run asset-watch-pool | Same as above, used in [some cases](https://laravel.com/docs/mix#running-mix). |
| npm run asset-hot | Compiles assets in development mode with hot reload option activated. |
| npm run asset-prod | Compiles assets for production. |
